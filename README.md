# Train ticket price 

Write a program that asks the user:
- The number of kilometers to travel
- The age of the passenger

Based on this informations, we have to calculate the total price of the travel ticket, according to the following rules:

- the ticket price is defined based on km (â‚¬0.21 per km)
- a 20% discount must be applied for minors
- a 40% discount applies for those over 65.

MILESTONE POINT 1:

We start by implementing the program without any aesthetics: using exclusively two inputs and a button (not stylized), we create the specifications written above. The final response (or output) will also be written in console.


MILESTONE POINT 2:

Only if Point 1 is complete and functional, will we create a form on the page where the user can enter the data and view the final calculation with the price.
The summary of the data and the output of the final price must be printed on the page (the price must be formatted with a maximum of two decimals, to indicate the cents on the price).
